Python is a multi-paradigm programming language that has primarily been developed as a more concise, straightforward, and easy-to-understand alternative to other major languages such as C, Java and Perl. Python programming is designed to be highly standardized, with a clear protocol for any task and little to no need for coming up with elaborate patchwork solutions to get something done.
